    "In this lab, we will go over some of the basics of builtin data types, assignments, and passing arguments to functions. These programming details will help in writing and reading code, and figuring out exactly what is happening (and avoid unexpected side effects). A lot of this development is from \"Learning Python\" by M. Lutz (O'Reilly Publishers) and that is a good book for programming reference in python.\n",
